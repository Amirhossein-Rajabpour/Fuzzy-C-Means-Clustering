# Fuzzy C-Means Clustering
## Computational Intelligence Course Project

In this project the `fuzzy` version of `K-Means` algorithm is implemented. Each datapoint is not forced to belong only to a specific 
cluster, but can belong to clusters to ‍‍`varying degrees`. Thats the difference between `fuzzy clustering` and `normal clustering`.
